/**
 *  <%= classify(name) %>ClientController is a testing controller that verifies that
 *  <%= classify(name) %>Module was generated properly.
 *
 *  You can quickly verify this by running `npm run start:dev`, and then
 *  connecting to `http://localhost:3000` with your browser.  It should return
 *  a custom message like `Hello from <%= classify(name) %>Module`.
 *
 *  Once you begin customizing <%= classify(name) %>Module, you'll probably want
 *  to delete this controller.
